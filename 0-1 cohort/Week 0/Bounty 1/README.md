# Bounty 1 - Adding segments to the YouTube player seekbar ($150)

## Requirements:
- You should be able to specify an array of segments (similar to youtube).
- The player seekbar should get divided into those segments.
- There should be a function (scrollToSegment) that lets the user scroll to the start of that specific segment.
- Additionally added feature of +5 forward skip and -5 backward skip.
